### 1. Can I use your scenepacks on all editing apps?

Yes you can, my scenepacks are not strictly for one app. They can be used for example on Capcut, Video Star, and others!

### 2. How can I find the Mega key to open the scenepack?
Mega keys are at behind the # in the link.

For example, https://mega.nz/folder/8TQ3wKQa<span style="color: red;">#IzZFjMQcHzo6m14G11hj6w</span>   - Everything in red is the key!

### 3. When I try opening the scenepack it says file not found or delete by owner.

If you have the problem please contact me on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dilfyscps/) and I will update the links on the website and my IG page.

### 3. How can I request a scenepack?

My requests are currently closed due to a lot of requests that I'm still trying to fulfill from my last request post. 

A notice on the website will be posted at the top of the page when I have my requests open.
